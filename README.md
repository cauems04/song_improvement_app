# guitar song improvement

## Objective and Problem

The idea of this project was first thought to solve a personal problem.

I've always been willing to learn songs I like without knowing much of music theory, so I had to learn them by searching for youtube tutorials and online tablatures. Unfortunately, I always struggle to learn how to play the whole songs (stop learning on the middle or just learn the very beggining), and I usually forget them with time. Those are the main problems I'm trying to solve.


As a solution, I've thought of an app that must have the following core features:
- Save the songs you want to learn;
- Play, listen to your recording, and make an auto-analysis;
- Keep track of your learning progress on each song;
- Organize the songs along with their links to external content (e. g: Youtube tutorials) and recording (consequently saving the musician's song portfolio).


Due to my personal problem experience, this project targets rokkies up to mid-level players who want to learn songs they like, follow  their progress and organize its data on an organized and pretty enviroment. 


## Starting the project

At the beggining, I was so excited to start that I did it with no usefull prior organization. Later on, I got so lost that I had to take a step back, create some useful diagrams, and organize the next tasks.

To create and organize the tasks, I created a Kanban dashboard on trello. To keep track of the tasks, label them based on importance (focusing on core tasks), and insert some future new ideas. 

I've also created two UML diagrams:

Use case diagram - It was important to have a better understaning on the app's features and look at it on ythe big picture.

Class diagram - Used it to understand the data I'd have to use on the app, and specially what data I'd have to store in the database.

(Diagrams' images will be inserted here very soon).
